Feature: Configure Mailchimp for a channel
  In order to integrate Mailchimp
  As an Administrator
  I want to be able to configure Mailchimp settings per channel

  Background:
  Given the store operates on a channel named "Web Store"  
	And I am logged in as an administrator

  Scenario: Admin can configure Mailchimp settings on a channel
    When I go to the "Web Store" channel edit page
    And I enable Mailchimp for the channel
    And I enable double opt-in for the channel
    And I select "eshop_en_list_id" as the Mailchimp list for the channel
    And I save the channel
    Then I should be notified that it has been successfully edited
    And the Mailchimp settings for channel "Web Store" should be:
      | isMailChimpEnabled                  | true      |
      | isMailChimpListDoubleOptInEnabled  | true      |
      | mailChimpListId                   | eshop_en_list_id |
